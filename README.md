# Fortify - Password Manager (Offline)

## Overview
Fortify is a simple and secure offline password manager that allows users to store, manage, and access their passwords conveniently. It functions like a notes app specifically for passwords, requiring a master password for access while keeping data stored locally on the user's device.


### Features

- **Master Password Protection**: Users must enter a master password every time they open the app to ensure security.
- **Offline Storage**: All passwords are stored locally on the device, making it a fully offline solution.
- **Password Management**:
    - Add new passwords.
    - Update existing passwords.
    - Delete passwords when no longer needed.
- **Smooth UI & Animations**: The app provides a modern and visually appealing user experience with fluid animations.

### Usage

1. **Launch the App**
   - Upon opening, the app prompts the user to enter the master password.
2. **Managing Passwords**
   - Add a new password entry by tapping the Add New button.
   - Edit an existing password by selecting it and making changes.
   - Remove a password when no longer needed.
3. **Security Considerations**
   - Since the app does not use encryption yet, users should ensure their device is secure.
   - The master password is required every time the app is accessed to prevent unauthorized usage.


## Limitations & Future Improvements

- **No Encryption**: Currently, stored passwords are not encrypted.
- **No Auto-Suggestions**: The app does not autofill passwords during login on other apps or websites.
- **Potential Enhancements**:
   - Implementing encryption for secure data storage.
   - Adding biometric authentication (fingerprint/face unlock).
   - Cloud backup & sync options for multi-device access.

## Conclusion

Fortify is a lightweight, user-friendly password manager that provides a straightforward way to store and manage passwords offline. Future updates may enhance security and usability with encryption and additional features.
